## Story:
I tried out film photography 1 year after using a digital Fujifilm X-E4 camera.

After seeing the scanned film I was happy with some of the pictures but the first thing I realized was:
- I don't know what aperture and shutter speed settings I used. I had come to rely on the settings that were saved with digital photos.

Because you cannot see the picture right away - it is more important to understand what settings you used since each shot costs money and is more deliberate.

Used pen and paper to track - add pics
Checked online if this was an issue people faced - on Reddit people used pen and paper just like i started.

## Business Logic:
Keep track of the camera settings used to take pictures taken with a film camera.

Users can quickly save aperature and shutter speed information for the picture they took since a film camera doesn't save that infomation automatically like digital cameras.
