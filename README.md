Problem/inconvenience I was facing:
I tried out film photography 1 year  of using a digital Fujifilm X-E4 camera.
Keep track of the camera settings used to take pictures taken with a film camera.

Users can quickly save aperature and shutter speed information for the picture they took since a film camera doesn't save that infomation automatically like digital cameras.
