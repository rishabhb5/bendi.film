Reel = Roll
Frame = Photo


General Notes on Paradigm Used: MVVM - Model, View, ViewModel
-------------------------------------------------------------
1. Model: Only cares about holding and representing data
2. View: Only cares about showing data on the screen (no business logic)
3. ViewModel: Business logic - acts as intermediary between the models and views

MVVM pattern:
- Views observe the ViewModel usign @ObservedObject and @StateObject
- The ViewModel publishes changes with @Published properties
- UI state is kept in the views with @State properties
- Data flows from ViewModel to Views
- User actions flow from Views to ViewModel


Architecture Breakdown for bendi.film
-------------------------------------------------------------
1. Model
    - Roll struct: collection of Photos
    - Photo struct: single frame with data properties like aperature and shutter speed

2. View
    - RollListView - shows list of all Rolls with Photos within them
    - AddRollView - add a new Roll
    - PhotoListView - shows list of all photos within a Roll
    - AddPhotoView - add a new photo within a Roll
    
3. ViewModel
    - RollViewModel
        - marked with @ObservableObject to publish changes to UI
        - contains business lgoci for adding/removing Rolls and Photos
        - maintains the source of truth for the app's data
